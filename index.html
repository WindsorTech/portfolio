        <p>Welcome! I am a highly motivated frontend developer with a background in business marketing, and experience in designing and creating a variety of web applications.</p>

        <p>Computer programming is my passion, and I have completed a Full Stack Web Software Engineering course at University of Central Florida, covering the latest in frontend and backend technologies. I also engage in creative work, including graphic design, media production, digital marketing and translation. I speak Portuguese and English fluently, also having a great understanding of Spanish.</p>
        
        <p>I like to travel and experience other cultures. I have visited many countries, and had the amazing opportunity to work for Walt Disney World in Florida, Marriott Resort on the Gold Coast in Australia and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.</p>

        <p>I am also passionate about entrepreneurship and the creation of business opportunities, being responsible for the foundation and development of the online travel project GoTripps.com.</p>

        <p>My work is performed with a lot of dedication, with great organizational skills and always striving for the best. <a href="portfolio.html" class="look">Take a look at my portfolio</a> and enjoy the cool applications I have developed so far!</p>

        <p>The love for what I do makes me always want to evolve and do better work. I am sure I can add great value to your organization, helping it achieve all its goals. Thank you for visiting!</p>
